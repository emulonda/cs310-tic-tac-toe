# cs310-tic-tac-toe
# Project Summary
This project gave me additional experience with the Gradle build system, and with the software testing tools that I was introduced to during my software engineering class. For this project, I implemented a working two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.
# Running the Program
The program requires a compiler compliance level of Java 1.8 to run.
To execute the program simply download the repository, compile the code, and run.

Complete the implementation, using the incomplete versions provided in the repository as a starting point. The only files that I received are the Java source files:

TicTacToe.java TicTacToeMove.java TicTacToeModel.java TicTacToeView.java TicTacToeController.java

My first version of this program will use the console for input and output;

Part Two of this assignment will involve upgrading my implementation to use a GUI. To make this transition easier, I provided implementation which is structured using the Model-View-Controller design pattern, in which the board is the Model, the terminal window is the View, and the Controller receives and processes keyboard input.
Output

When the game is finished, the output should precisely match the following example (the players' input is shown in bold):

012

0 --- 1 --- 2 ---

Player 1 (X) Move: Enter the row and column numbers, separated by a space: 1 1

012

0 --- 1 -X- 2 ---

Player 2 (O) Move: Enter the row and column numbers, separated by a space: 0 1

012

0 -O- 1 -X- 2 ---

Player 1 (X) Move: Enter the row and column numbers, separated by a space: 0 0

012

0 XO- 1 -X- 2 ---

Player 2 (O) Move: Enter the row and column numbers, separated by a space: 1 2

012

0 XO- 1 -XO 2 ---

Player 1 (X) Move: Enter the row and column numbers, separated by a space: 2 2

012

0 XO- 1 -XO 2 --X

X!
